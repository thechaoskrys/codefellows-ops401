## Assignment Questions
**1. How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?**
- I would convince the company by pointing out that certain enterprises are held to a standard of security and compliance controls, therefore, being SOC2 compliant will give businesses the piece of mind neeeded to do business. 

**2. What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?**
- Security: The foundational security principle, common to all audits.
- Availability: Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required.
- Processing Integrity: Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner.
- Confidentiality: Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
- Privacy: The use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected.

**3. How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?**
- The levels of the SOC2 pyramid can be compared to a house. The foundation is built to ensure the safety of the home built will not crumble. The second level places an emphasis on excecution/security procedures. This is ensuring the home has proper windows and doors to protect the occupants inside. Lastly, the third level is about proof and documentation. This is submitting permits to ensure that the house was built appropriately and that everything that needed to be done to safeguard the house was actually done.
