# The Growth Mindset
- It is very important to address biases in the workplace upfront. It allows for all members of a team to feel comfortable and heard so that they can focus on mission readiness. My bias results stated I am highly self-aware, which I agree with. I try my very best in every work environment to ensure that all parties are heard and that I am being fair and equal to all members of my team. I take the time to listen to any concers and ensure all needs are adequately met.
